_**pvpaR** is a platform for the automatic identification and classification of faults and performance loss in Photovoltaic systems_

The paper describing the platform will be published in the 43rd IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists conference proceedings, under the title "Development of a Novel Web Application for Automatic Photovoltaic System Performance Analysis and Fault Identification."
A poster will be presented at the above conference on the 8th of June 2016, at 12:00 in Area 9, Exhibit Hall A1, Oregon Convention Center.


## Features

- Import [time-series](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html) of PV system measurements and meteorological conditions
- Imported data can be in the form of flat files (e.g. csv, xls(x), txt etc.) or database tables (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, Cassandra etc.) or scraped from the [web](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html)
- User selectable date ranges
- Plot measurements and model results as [dynamic graphs](http://dygraphs.com/)
- Model the expected PV system performance from meteorological measurements
- Model and [transpose](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/solaR/index.html) the incident irradiance to the plane of array
- Model module temperature
- Compares model results with recorded measurements and checks for measurement errors
- Identifies outliers and abnormal performance losses
- Classifies the identified faults and shows the occurence of the identified fault


## Usage

Create a spec file describing the PV system. For an example see [specs.R](App/specs.R)

Run the `runShiny.R` script:

`$ R CMD BATCH ~/pvpaR/runShiny.R`

or, to run R in a separate process:

`$ R âˆ’e "shiny::runApp('~/pvpaR/App', launch.browser = TRUE)"`


## Bugs

Submit any bugs as [issues](https://github.com/alexisph/pvpaR/issues).


## Roadmap

The following features are planned for development:

- KPIs
    1. Performance Ratio
    2. Exported energy (and all-time high)
    3. System uptime and downtime
    4. Expected energy yield (e.g. progress bar)
    5. ~~Inverter efficiency~~
- Granularity
    1. Dataset minimum
    2. 15 min
    3. Hourly
    4. Daily
    5. Monthly
    6. Yearly
- ~~Modifiable settings (e.g. soiling)~~
- RMSE, MAE and MBE for V, I, G and P predictions
- User selectable sources of irradiance:
    - Locally measured GHI transposed onto the plane of array (POA)
    - Locally measured Gpoa
    - PVGIS or NASA hourly on the POA
    - Clear-sky model
- User selectable sources of temperature:
    - Locally measured Tmod
    - Locally measured Tamb and u_w used to predict Tmod
    - Tamb from NASA or PVGIS
- Estimation of seasonal and trend components
- Separate early degradation from long-term degradation trend
- User selectable filters such as:
    - High Gi
    - Low Gi
    - Low AOI
    - Low Gi volatility
    - Low u_w value and volatility (for temperature stability)
    - Irradiance around the maximum unclipped power
- Cache results, e.g. [archivist](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/archivist/index.html)
