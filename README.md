_**pvpaR** is a platform for the automatic identification and classification of faults and performance loss in Photovoltaic systems_

The paper describing the platform was published in the 43rd IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists conference proceedings, under the title "Development of a Novel Web Application for Automatic Photovoltaic System Performance Analysis and Fault Identification."
A poster was presented at the above conference on the 8th of June 2016, at 12:00 in Area 9, Exhibit Hall A1, Oregon Convention Center.


## Features

- Import [time-series](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html) of PV system and meteorological measurements. Imported data can be in the form of flat files (e.g. csv, xls(x), txt etc.) or database tables (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQLite, MongoDB, Cassandra etc.) or scraped from the [web](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html)
- User selectable date ranges applied to the whole platform
- Plot measurements and model results in [interactive graphs](http://dygraphs.com/)
- Model the expected PV system performance from meteorological measurements and past PV system performance
- Model and [transpose](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/solaR/index.html) the incident irradiance to the plane of array
- Model module temperature
- Compare model results with actual measurements and indicate measurement errors
- Identify faults and sub-optimal performance
- Classify identified faults


## Usage

Create a specification file describing the PV system. For an example see [specs.R](App/specs.R)

Run the `runShiny.R` script:

`$ R CMD BATCH ~/pvpaR/runShiny.R`

or, to run R in a separate process:

`$ R âˆ’e "shiny::runApp('~/pvpaR/App', launch.browser = TRUE)"`
